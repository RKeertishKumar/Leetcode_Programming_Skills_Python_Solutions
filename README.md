# Leetcode Programming Skills Python Solutions

The repo has a well-commented markdown file for the programming skills section of Leetcode problems for quick review.

## Question 1

**1768. Merge Strings Alternately**

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

### Example 1

**Input:** `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "pqr"`  
**Output:** `"apbqcr"`  
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
```
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        # Let's have an empty string to store the new string
        new_string = ""

        # Find the minimum length of both the strings so we know until which index the loop has to run so that we don't get an out of index error
        minlen = min(len(word1), len(word2))

        # Let's go through both the strings and add the character to the new array
        for i in range(minlen):
            new_string += word1[i]
            new_string += word2[i]

        # Use the slice function to add the remaining characters. If there are no remaining characters, it doesn't add anything
        # Notice we start the slicing form the minimum length, thus only the word with the greater length of the variable will be added.
        new_string += word1[minlen:]
        new_string += word2[minlen:]

        return new_string
```
## Question 2

**389. Find the Difference**

You are given two strings s and t.String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.

### Example 1:

**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
**Output:** "e"
**Explanation:** 'e' is the letter that was added.

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # We will use low level ASCII logic to quickly calculate this. Hence, assign value 0 to an empty string

        ans = 0
        # We iterate through the string until the minimum value of string

        for i in range(len(s)):

            # Add the ASCII value of each character from the string with the extra character. We use ord function which returns the ASCII value of the character passed as parameter
            ans += ord(t[i])
                
            # Minus the ASCII value of character from the other string so that the difference left eventually would be the numerical value of the character we seek.
            ans -= ord(s[i])
            
            # Increment value of i to iterate through the loop
            i += 1

        # Since, we have one character remaining which isn't added in the first iteration, we add that here.
        ans += ord(t[len(s)])

        # chr() function returns the character when the ASCII value is passed as the parameter
        return chr(ans)
```

## Question 3

**28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String**

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        return haystack.find(needle)
```

Other approaches to explain in case of interview:
We could make use of a loop and slice function to compare the sliced haystack string with the needle.

## Question 4

**242. Valid Anagram**

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
**Output:** true

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```
Other approches:
Sort the strings and compare the sorted string to check if they are an anagram or not.

## Question 5

**459. Repeated Substring Pattern**

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abab"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** It is the substring "ab" twice.

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return s in s[1:] + s[:-1]
```
